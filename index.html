            <p>Hi! I am Sheikh Md Obaidullah, a web designer/developer focused on crafting great web experiences.
                Designing and Coding have been my passion since the days I started working with computers but I found
                myself into web design/development since 2021. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and
                functional websites.</p>

            <p> For over past 1 month , I have worked for some of the best digital agencies and wonderful clients to
                create some award winning works. And, I can make this happen for your business as well..</p>

            <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development Hero.</p>
